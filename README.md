PHP Type Inference
===

Given a list of function signatures and an expression involving those functions, this project allows you to infer the most general type information about each parameter of that expression.

Functions can have overloaded arguments and overloaded return types, can be supplied as arguments to other functions, and can take either one or two arguments (support for an arbitrary number of arguments is a planned feature).
